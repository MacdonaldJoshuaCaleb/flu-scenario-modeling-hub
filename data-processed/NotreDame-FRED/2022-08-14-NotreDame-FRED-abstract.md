# Summary of Results

# General Model Description

# Explanation of observed dynamics given model assumptions

# Model Calibration

# Model Assumptions
## Immunity assumptions
Based on SMH requirements

### Number/type of immune classes considered


### Initial proportion of population with residual immunity from previous infections and previous seasonal vaccinations (by age, if available)


### Waning immunity throughout the season (yes, no, differs for vaccination and natural infection)


## Details on Influenza Strain(s)
### Number of strains/subtypes included in model


### Strain(s) specifications (immune escape, transmissibility)

### Are interactions between strains/subtypes implicitly modeled?
NA

## Seasonality implementation


## Initial Conditions
### Details on circulating strains at the start of the projection period

## Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)


## Age Group Variability
### No of age groups

### Age-stratification differences (susceptibility, vaccine effectiveness, waning)

## State-level Variability
### State-stratification details (prior immunity, vaccine coverage)

## Vaccine Effectiveness
### VE against infection (by age, if relevant)


### VE against mortality (by age, if relevant)


### VE against transmission (by age, if relevant)


## Other Model Assumptions
