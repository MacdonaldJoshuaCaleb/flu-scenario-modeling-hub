methods: For each state/territory our scenario projections are generated using a mechanistic model with S[Sv]I[Iv]HR compartments, where 'v' subscripts indicate vaccinated and each compartment is age-stratified. We use the populations and vaccine time series provided by the Scenario Hub and assume that the infection-susceptibility of vaccinated individuals is reduced by one half of vaccine effectiveness. Estimates for R_0 and infection-hospitalization-ratio priors were taken from model fits to the exemplar seasons.  Initial susceptibles were estimated as 70% of each age group.  Seeding priors were estimated using historic ILI+ peaks for the appropriate influenza sub-type.
