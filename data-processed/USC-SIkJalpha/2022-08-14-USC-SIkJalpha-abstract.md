# Model Assumptions
## Immunity assumptions
### Number/type of immune classes considered
2: Immune/Not Immune

### Initial proportion of population with residual immunity from previous infections and previous seasonal vaccinations (by age, if available)
We assume a prior immunity of 33% or 16.5% depending on the scenarios, not from previous infections/vaccinations. 

### Waning immunity throughout the season (yes, no, differs for vaccination and natural infection)
No

## Details on Influenza Strain(s)
### Number of strains/subtypes included in model
Single strain model

### Strain(s) specifications (immune escape, transmissibility)
FILL

### Are interactions between strains/subtypes implicitly modeled?
No

## Seasonality implementation
FILL

## Initial Conditions
### Details on circulating strains at the start of the projection period
Single strain model

## Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
Not considered

## Age Group Variability
### No of age groups
0-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+.

### Age-stratification differences (susceptibility, vaccine effectiveness, waning)
Each age group is considered independently of one another. 

## State-level Variability
### State-stratification details (prior immunity, vaccine coverage)
States are considered independently of eachother. Same prior immunity is used across all states and the vaccine coverage used is from the provided data between the different states.

## Vaccine Effectiveness
### VE against infection (by age, if relevant)
High VE Scenarios: 62.4000   21.9231   51.0000   51.0000   36.0000 for 0-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+.
Low VE Scnearios: 48.0000   19.2492   25.0000   14.0000   12.0000 for 0-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+.

### VE against mortality (by age, if relevant)
High VE Scenarios: 62.4000   21.9231   51.0000   51.0000   36.0000 for 0-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+.
Low VE Scnearios: 48.0000   19.2492   25.0000   14.0000   12.0000 for 0-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+.

### VE against transmission (by age, if relevant)
